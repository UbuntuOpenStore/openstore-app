/**
 * QML plugin to query if authentication is required and do authentication.
 *
 * At the moment the plugin is expected to be used as follows:
 *
 * - Ask if authentication is required (requireAuthentication() function). This will
 *   return true if Ubuntu Touch user has selected some unlocking security (PIN code or password).
 * - If so, the application should provide a dialog to ask for the PIN code/password and
 *   call validatePasswordToken(provided password) function.
 * - If validatePasswordToken() function returns true for given token, then user was authenticated,
 *   otherwise failed to authenticate.
 *
 * Caveats:
 *
 * - If user failed to authenticate, it doesn't necessarily mean password was invalid. Failure
 *   can also be because of account being locked or password being expired or because of some other
 *   reason in the underlying pam library. The exact reason is not currently available to QML, as practically
 *   for normal users the only reason is password mismatch. If the user has done advanced modifications
 *   the exact reason for failure can be seen in application's logs.
 * - Currently the application using this module will have to provide the dialogs asking for
 *   for PIN/password and an error dialog. This will most likely change in future, but there's no
 *   concrete plans yet. Discussion at https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-filemanager-dev/ubuntu-filemanager-app/require-screenlock-password/+merge/230058
 *   can be seen for some background information.
 *
 * Simplified skeleton QML code example that asks for authentication if required at start-up of application (specific dialogs omitted):
 *
 * import com.ubuntu.PamAuthentication 0.1
 *
 * MainView {
 *   PamAuthentication {
 *     id: pamAuthentication
 *     serviceName: "applicationName"
 *   }
 *
 *   Component.onCompleted: {
 *     if (pamAuthentication.requireAuthentication()) {
 *        var passwordToken = queryPasswordInputDialog()
 *        if (!pamAuthentication.validatePasswordToken(passwordToken) {
 *           // Successs...
 *        } else  {
 *           showAuthenticationFailedDialog()
 *        }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
